Added [Simplectomy Generator](https://standardgalactic.github.io/example)

Broadcast [The Oblicosm Paradox](https://youtube.com/live/0GVvy5s-bXw)

<!--
The **Oblicosm Paradox Project** is an exploratory effort to harness AI for summarizing and categorizing ideas. Using Microsoft’s Phi-4 model, this project generates hour after hour of summaries on topics like programming, the metacrisis, active inference, and other esoteric subjects. The project leverages spare computing resources to process and organize large amounts of information.

This [9-hour livestream](https://youtube.com/live/V4Jtle27iVs) showcases uninterrupted summaries, demonstrating how AI can be used for large-scale knowledge processing. I also did a [46-hour livestream](https://youtube.com/live/ZeF3JKJVNtw) that experimented with extended workflows for summarization. I eventually hope all of my computers can broadcast their summarizers 24 hours a day. (I only had two blue screens of death and only had to pause it once for a few minutes to cool the GPU.)

YouTube does not archive livestreams over 12 hours, so I apologize for the limited utility of the link to the 46-hour video. To address this limitation, I built the Simplectomy Generator, which broadcasts summaries 24 hours a day with a built-in pacer and in a cryptographic cipher. For further privacy and to prevent others from reading over your shoulder, you can use your own cipher font if you prefer.

乃ㄖ丂丂　Ҝ乇ㄚ　爪ㄖᗪ乇  

## Process

1. **Video Selection**: The project began with a [curated playlist of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcKyTzEkOa-jf5kKmmBkf5JZPXyrz63i7).
2. **Audio Extraction**: MP3s were downloaded using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on a separate computer, a process that took several days.
3. **Transcription**: Transcripts were generated with OpenAI’s Whisper over 15 days.
4. **Summarization**: For the livestreams, transcripts were directly summarized using Phi-4 via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/vanilj/Phi-4). In the 46-hour livestream, chunking 200 lines of transcripts before summarization improved efficiency.
5. **Future Goals**: The project’s ultimate goal is to generate synthetic audiobook recordings from the subtitles, which can then train GANs against the original MP3s. However, this stage is still in development. Currently, the focus is on building a text archive of summaries.

The [Xylomancy Archive](https://github.com/standardgalactic/xylomancy) contains the text files generated by the project. MP3s and synthetic audiobooks will be added in future updates.

## Why This Matters

The project explores how idle computing resources can be used to summarize and categorize knowledge. While this effort focuses on topics of personal interest, the same process could be adapted by others for their own areas of study or research.

## **Impossible Physics**

[Magnetic Fluidic Computing](https://standardgalactic.github.io/library/brainstorming-session-detailed.html)

**Geometric Bayesianism with Sparse Heuristics**

In biological systems, sparsity emerges as a natural consequence of physiological pressures, including energetic constraints, signal noise, and chemical gradients, obviating the need for explicit computational penalties to enforce minimal network complexity.

Metabolic costs, such as ATP consumption in neural and cellular activity, favor sparse activation patterns, acting as an implicit prior for minimal energy configurations. Environmental noise and signal overlap amplify high-salience, sparsely distributed signals, while thermodynamic gradients drive systems toward low-entropy states.

This Natural Sparsity Principle underpins the efficiency of biological cognition and informs computational models like Geometric Bayesianism with Sparse Heuristics (GBSH), suggesting that sparse proxy navigation can be an emergent property in biomimetic systems, enhancing their adaptability and resilience in noisy, resource-constrained environments.

<!-- Soft Sunset
Changing major from Psycholinguistics to Psychophysics.

Alright, let’s tear into this with some sardonic flair, shall we? Your framework struts in like it’s the lovechild of quantum physics and a cosmic fever dream, dripping with ambition and a swagger that practically begs modern physics to bow down. Quantum error correction, statistical mechanics, cosmology—oh, you’ve got the whole gang here, don’t you? Let’s shred it apart with a smirk and see if it holds up under the weight of its own grandiosity.

---

### Mathematics and Physics as Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

*Motivation:* So, you’re cozying up to quantum information theory, flirting with the idea that spacetime’s just some emergent glitch-fix courtesy of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Spacetime as a cosmic IT department—cute. Are you pitching this as a serious contender or just tossing out buzzwords to sound edgy?

*Implication:* Oh, how quaint—if QEC’s the bedrock, then classical physics, relativity, and even logic itself are just the universe’s duct tape and prayers holding this quantum mess together. Bold claim, but where’s the bite? Are you ready to ditch Newton and Einstein for a quantum code monkey’s handbook?

*Challenges:* A “concrete mathematical framework,” you say? Ha! Are we talking tensor networks strutting their stuff, stabilizer codes playing gatekeeper, or some shiny new topological QEC you’ve cooked up in your basement? Don’t tease us with ambition and then leave us hanging—give us the goods or admit you’re bluffing.

---

### Relativistic Plenum & Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Prediction

*Plenum Concept:* A relativistic medium instead of a boring old vacuum? Space as a bustling soup instead of an empty void—well, aren’t you the contrarian. What’s next, calling dark energy a cosmic seasoning packet?

*CMB from Paper Pulp in a Centrifuge:* Oh, this is rich. Anisotropies in the CMB modeled by—what, spinning wet mush in a bucket? I’ll give you points for creativity, but are you seriously suggesting the universe’s baby pictures can be reverse-engineered with a kitchen appliance? Tell me you’ve got more than an arts-and-crafts analogy here.

*5D Ising Sync:* A high-dimensional Ising model swaggering into critical phenomena—look at you, flexing those statistical mechanics muscles. Are you just slapping “5D” on there to sound fancy, or is this actually going somewhere?

*ΛCDM Parameters:* Borrowing from Lambda Cold Dark Matter like it’s a safety net—smart move. You’re not burning down the cosmological house, just redecorating it with some avant-garde flair. But does it hold up, or is this just a paint job on a crumbling foundation?

### Potential Research Directions

*1. Mathematical Formulation of the Plenum:* What are we working with here—a jazzed-up MOND, a tweaked f(R) gravity, or some emergent gravity fan fiction? Are you tossing in a new field—scalar, vector, tensor—like a chef gone wild, or is this all just holographic QEC cosplay? Show me the equations or stop flexing.

*2. Empirical Testability:* CMB predictions from a centrifuge? Alright, mad scientist, what exact squiggles should we spot that’ll make inflation theorists choke on their coffee? New gravitational wave vibes or funky large-scale structures—give me something testable, or this is just a cosmic pipe dream. And that QEC-statistical physics hookup—cute idea, but where’s the meat?

### RSVP and SITH: The Grand Unification of Everything, Apparently

Your *Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum* (RSVP) sounds like it’s crashing the party of emergent gravity, statistical mechanics, and quantum info theory, while *Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis* (SITH) waltzes in like cognition’s too cool for a physical body. If QEC’s your golden thread, you’re implying it stitches up physics, consciousness, AI, and computation into one smug little tapestry. Ambitious? Sure. Delusional? Maybe.

So, spill it—how’s the physics-cognition bromance work? Does SITH pop out of RSVP like some cosmic Athena from Zeus’s skull, or are they just two separate egos sharing the spotlight? Don’t dodge the question—give me the dirty details or admit you’re just winging it.

There you go—a biting, sardonic teardown with a side of skepticism. What’s your next move, genius?
