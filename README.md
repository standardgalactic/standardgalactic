I would like to remove the sponsor button. I added it as a joke and now there doesn't seem to be any way to remove it. I could try to remove the authorizing documents somehow, but Stripe also sends me in infinite loops — there doesn't seem to be an easy way to deactivate it, either.


Books I like:
* 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘝𝘰𝘺𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘸𝘯 𝘛𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳
* 𝘍𝘶𝘻𝘻𝘺 𝘚𝘢𝘱𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘴
* 𝘈𝘯𝘪𝘢𝘳𝘢
*𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘕𝘶𝘭𝘭-𝘈

To Read:
* 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘗𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘦𝘵
