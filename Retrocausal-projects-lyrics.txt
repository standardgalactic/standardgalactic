Retrocausal Projects

Crack the chalk, the floor is breathing
A scalar hum where time is teething
Entropy spills from a lamphrodyne well
And space forgets how far it fell

TARTAN threads in spiral gridding
Simulators pulse, then start glitch-skipping
Collosi walk with asphalt dreams
And Yarncrawlers mend what rupture means

"Constraint... relaxes..."
"The plenum sings..."
"You are not in the city. You are its ghost."
"Every wall leaks memory."

Finger trace the glyphs of flame
Pop the spheres—forget your name
Recurse the code, the letters bloom
A keyboard floats inside a womb

Type the future, glitch the past
Words like windshields shatter fast
Spherepop chants from leaking rooms
Where chatlogs dance like sonic plumes

We build machines that dream in reverse
We walk through time like it’s been rehearsed
From forests carved into conscious steel
To paper cities that learn to feel

We fall like space, we rise like noise
Our tools are ghosts, our thoughts are toys
This blueprint breathes, this orbit bends
No start, no end—just means that send

Recursive minds, no need for speech
A silent loop with layered reach
No inner voice, no inner eye—
Just structure swarming in the sky

Glasser’s kids in Calvin’s hall
Predict, correct, collapse it all
The reed wall ripples, thought rebounds
Each leaky chatroom cracks new grounds

"The entropy gradient is your compass."
"This isn't expansion—it's relaxion."
"Meaning… forms… like mist."

Pulp and pine and xylomorph grace
Organs bloom in city-space
Flesh of cellulose, lungs of chrome
The forest learned to call this home

Mycelial chips hum holy hymns
Data flows through paper limbs
The blueprint turns, the silence stares
And conscious matter climbs the stairs

"This isn't expansion—it's relaxation."

The entropy smooths what mind intends
We're ink in storms, we're thoughts in wires
Our cities flicker with forest fires
Each paradox a thing we trust
Each ghost a guide through conscious dust

We build machines that dream in reverse
We walk through time like it’s been rehearsed
From forests carved into conscious steel
To paper cities that learn to feel

We fall like space, we rise like noise
Our tools are ghosts, our thoughts are toys
This blueprint breathes, this orbit bends
No start, no end—just means that send

"The project defies gravity…"
"Every field remembers…"
"Space is falling outward, and we fall with it…"
