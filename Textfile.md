The modes of Aristotle are unnecessarily restricted.

As we shall have occasion to point out, the reasons for the syllogistic form are psychological, not logical:

The syllogism, made up of the smallest number of propositions (three), each with the smallest number of terms (two), by which any generality of reasoning can be attained, represents the limits of human attention, not logical necessity.

To regard the syllogism as indispensable, or as reasoning *par excellence* (in italics), is the apotheosis of stupidity.
